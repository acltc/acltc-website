                The Live Training is the main act, and in just 12 weeks your Lead Instructor will help you transform from a coding newbie to an entry-level software developer capable of teaching yourself any new technology.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                The online Live Training is completely different than other online offerings – this isn’t a set of exercises that students log into and complete on their own time. Our program is an “in-person online” experience and there are set class times (Monday through Thursday evenings and all day Sunday) where the Lead Instructor is teaching and providing exercises throughout. Nothing is pre-recorded – students are able to communicate with other students and ask questions during each live class session. Everyone can see the Lead Instructor and all their classmates at all times - even during the exercises.
                </h5>
                <h5>The student learning experience centers around video conferencing into each class session. Each student uses both their laptop as well as an external monitor attached to it. The student does their actual work on their laptop, and the video conferencing platform remains on the external monitor, where the students can see both their lead instructor and classmates.

            The Lead Instructor and all the students remain in the virtual classroom as they tackle the exercises. When students need help, they can send a chat message to the Lead Instructor and the Lead Instructor jumps into a one-on-one video conference to privately answer student questions. At this time, students can share their own screen with the Lead instructor, and can even grant access to the Lead Instructor to remotely type into the student’s computer. This means students can ask instructors or each other for help and get the immediate feedback that is critical to learning.

                While the particular languages and frameworks we use to teach are those that we feel are best suited towards teaching, they also happen to be very popular in the industry today. They include Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, VueJS, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Git. You’ll learn back end development by utilizing and creating APIs, delving into database design, and working with Ruby on Rails. You’ll learn front-end development using JavaScript and VueJS, a powerful JavaScript framework.

                    Apprenticeship
                </h2>
                <h5>
            After the Live Training, Actualize graduates have the option to become an apprentice for The Difference Engine for up to 4 months while seeking their first software engineering job. The Difference Engine does web development work for other non-profits at no cost, and is a win-win for everybody.
            </h5>
            <h5>
            Each apprentice is assigned to a team that works on a particular project. Teammates work in pairs (known as pair programming) and are also supervised by a Tech Lead, a more experienced developer who provides additional guidance.
            </h5>
            <h5>
            Every day apprenticing makes you more competitive in the industry and more likely to land the software development position of your dreams. In particular, apprentices gain real-world experience in their new profession and build a portfolio of real client projects that are impressive to prospective hiring managers. In addition, apprentices learn skills that one just can't get in a classroom, including team collaboration, working professionally with clients, and agile development.
            </h5>
            <h5>
            Apprentices and their Tech Leads meet two nights a week, although many apprentices do additional work on their own time when they can.
