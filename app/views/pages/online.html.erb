                </h2>
                <p>During Prework, you’ll be ramping up for class by watching videos of our CEO, Jay Wengrow, teaching the fundamentals of coding. Due to Jay’s quirky sense of humor, these videos may arguably be the most entertaining coding videos you’ll have ever seen. More importantly, though, Jay’s experience as both an educator and developer come to the fore as he breaks down each concept into a digestible chunk before moving onto the next. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Each video is also accompanied by a series of exercises, which you’ll submit via a specialized application called the Student Portal. Each exercise is reviewed by a Teaching Assistant, and you’ll receive constructive feedback where necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                You can complete prework on your own schedule, although you should block off at least 20 hours to dedicate towards it.

                <p>
                The Live Training is the main act, and in just 12 weeks your Lead Instructor will help you transform from a coding newbie to an entry-level software developer capable of teaching yourself any new technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                The online Live Training is completely different than other online offerings – this isn’t a set of exercises that students log into and complete on their own time. Our program is an “in-person online” experience and there are set class times (Monday through Thursday evenings and all day Sunday) where the Lead Instructor is teaching and providing exercises throughout. Nothing is pre-recorded – students are able to communicate with other students and ask questions during each live class session. Everyone can see the Lead Instructor and all their classmates at all times - even during the exercises.
                </p>
                <p>The student learning experience centers around video conferencing into each class session. Each student uses both their laptop as well as an external monitor attached to it. The student does their actual work on their laptop, and the video conferencing platform remains on the external monitor, where the students can see both their lead instructor and classmates.

            </p>
            <p>
                During instruction, the Lead Instructor’s face is the main focus on the external monitor while introducing the new lesson, with the classmates off to the side.

            <p>
                While demoing code, the Lead Instructor shares their screen while the classmates’ faces are off to the side.

            The Lead Instructor and all the students remain in the virtual classroom as they tackle the exercises. When students need help, they can send a chat message to the Lead Instructor and the Lead Instructor jumps into a one-on-one video conference to privately answer student questions. At this time, students can share their own screen with the Lead instructor, and can even grant access to the Lead Instructor to remotely type into the student’s computer. This means students can ask instructors or each other for help and get the immediate feedback that is critical to learning.

                During the Live Training, we teach software engineering using full stack web development. While we teach with specific technologies, what you’ll really learn is how to think like a developer, and be able to pick up anything software-related on your own.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the particular languages and frameworks we use to teach are those that we feel are best suited towards teaching, they also happen to be very popular in the industry today. They include Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, VueJS, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Git. You’ll learn back end development by utilizing and creating APIs, delving into database design, and working with Ruby on Rails. You’ll learn front-end development using JavaScript and VueJS, a powerful JavaScript framework.

                </h2>
            <p>Even after you’ve graduated the bootcamp, we don’t just let you go - we’re committed to your success! After the Live Training, Actualize graduates have the option to join our Apprenticeship program for up to 4 months while seeking their first software engineering job. This program contains three components:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Apprenticeship:</strong> Build realistic applications in a structured team environment under the auspices of experienced software engineers. This is a great way to continue to hone your coding skills, build up your portfolio, and learn what it’s really like to work in a professional software development environment.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Job Hacking:</strong> During the bootcamp, we train you regarding the necessary professional networking and personal branding skills that you need to land your first job. During the apprenticeship, we run a structured support group that offers accountability and continued advice and support for the job hacking process.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Interview Prep:</strong> Prepare for interviews by working with your fellow apprentices on real coding interview problems.
            </p>
            <p>Apprentices and their Tech Leads meet two nights a week.</p>
