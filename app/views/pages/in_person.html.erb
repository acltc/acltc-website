                </h2>
                <p class="">During Prework, you’ll be ramping up for class by watching videos of our CEO, Jay Wengrow, teaching the fundamentals of coding. Due to Jay’s quirky sense of humor, these videos may arguably be the most entertaining coding videos you’ll have ever seen. More importantly, though, Jay’s experience as both an educator and developer come to the fore as he breaks down each concept into a digestible chunk before moving onto the next. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Each video is also accompanied by a series of exercises, which you’ll submit via a specialized application called the Student Portal. Each exercise is reviewed by a Teaching Assistant, and you’ll receive constructive feedback where necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                You can complete prework on your own schedule, although you should block off at least 20 hours to dedicate towards it.

                <p>
                The Live Training is the main act, and in just 12 weeks your Lead Instructor will help you transform from a coding newbie to an entry-level software developer capable of teaching yourself any new technology.
            </p>
            <p>
            During the Live Training, the Lead Instructor flips back and forth between instruction and exercises. Instruction is more than lecture; the Lead Instructor demos a new concept by sharing the screen with the class on a large projector, and leads an interactive discussion on the subject.
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after the new concept is taught, students are presented with exercises that give them the chance to utilize the new concept in various scenarios, allowing them to truly grasp it. During the exercise, the Lead Instructor and Teaching Assistants are available to help out when any student gets stuck. And right after the exercises, the class goes back into Instruction mode and moves onto the next concept.</p>
            <p>This model of an instruction-driven class is very different than the typical coding bootcamp, which are exercise-driven. That is, in other bootcamps, students are taught new concepts by being given exercises, and the staff is on site to help students when they need help. There may be some ad-hoc lectures, but the students are essentially teaching themselves most of the material through exercises. The Actualize approach is to teach every concept through expert instruction, and follow the instruction with exercises on that concept. This approach allows us to cover the same amount of material as other bootcamp in a fraction of the time.

            <p>
                During the Live Training, we teach software engineering using full stack web development. While we teach with specific technologies, what you’ll really learn is how to think like a developer, and be able to pick up anything software-related on your own. In fact, a number of Actualize grads branch out into other software roles, such as mobile development and system administration.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the particular languages and frameworks we use to teach are those that we feel are best suited towards teaching, they also happen to be very popular in the industry today. They include Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, VueJS, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Git. You’ll learn back end development by utilizing and creating APIs, delving into database design, and working with Ruby on Rails. You’ll learn front-end development using JavaScript and VueJS, a powerful JavaScript framework.

                    Apprenticeship
                </h2>
                <p>
            After the Live Training, Actualize graduates have the option to become an apprentice for The Difference Engine for up to 4 months while seeking their first software engineering job. The Difference Engine does web development work for other non-profits at no cost, and is a win-win for everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each apprentice is assigned to a team that works on a particular project. Teammates work in pairs (known as pair programming) and are also supervised by a Tech Lead, a more experienced developer who provides additional guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every day apprenticing makes you more competitive in the industry and more likely to land the software development position of your dreams. In particular, apprentices gain real-world experience in their new profession and build a portfolio of real client projects that are impressive to prospective hiring managers. In addition, apprentices learn skills that one just can't get in a classroom, including team collaboration, working professionally with clients, and agile development.
            </p>
            <p>
            Apprentices and their Tech Leads meet two nights a week, although many apprentices do additional work on their own time when they can.
