                    Actualize is the only coding bootcamp that exclusively hires Lead Instructors who have professional experience in both education and software engineering. Your Lead Instructor is your guide and mentor during the 12 weeks of Live Training, and will directly teach you every concept that you need to know to become a software developer.

                    Your Lead Instructor is there for you - both in and out of class - to guide you, celebrate your success, and help smooth out the bumps you’ll encounter as you tackle some of the toughest problems you’ll have ever taken on in your life. Each Lead Instructor is empathic, funny, and engaging, and that is why many of our graduates have told us that their Lead Instructor is hands-down the best part of their Actualize experience.

                                    Peter Jang is a Chicago Lead Instructor as well as the Dean of Instruction at Actualize. He has had several career changes - he started as a a mechanical engineer, working with programming languages such as C, C++, Matlab, Excel VBA, and Python. He then followed his passion for teaching and worked as a high school math teacher for 6 years. More recently he changed into a career as a web developer, working at a startup as a full stack web developer. Currently he teaches full time as a Chicago Lead Instructor, which is a perfect blend of his passions for both teaching and programming.

                                    Danielle attended the University of Santa Cruz, California and graduated with a BS in biology. While pursuing a career in that field, she became interested in programming and attended a coding bootcamp to learn as much as possible, unaware of the life change she was about to make. She fell in love with coding and design and worked as a front end developer and designer. But she also found a passion for mentoring and education - and taught web development as well. Motivated by growth mindset, passionate about learning, and engaged by problem solving, she found the perfect intersection becoming a Lead Instructor at Actualize.

                <p class="">We believe that teaching people to code is much, much more than dumping students in a room and throwing articles and exercises at them, as is the style of most coding bootcamps. As educator-developers, we study the art and science of teaching people to code with a passion that borders on fanaticism. (Okay, maybe it is fanaticism!) 
                </p>
                <p>
                Our educational approach does not focus on teaching our students a particular language or technology, but instead how to think as a software engineer, with the ability to teach themselves any technology on their own. In fact, the majority of our graduates go on to work with other languages and frameworks than the ones we teach in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is also our educational approach that allows us to teach on a part-time basis what other programs take an entire day to teach. In the words of one student who transferred to Actualize from another program, "You teach the concepts so well that it takes 30 minutes to learn what it took me 5 hours to learn in my previous school."
