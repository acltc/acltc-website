                        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>We believe that education is a lot more than simply conveying information. Education is about studying how people learn and think, and designing ways to ensure that students truly grasp the material being taught. Every individual has a different way of thinking, and each concept needs a unique approach in how it can best be clarified. Leaving the craft of education to people who are subject matter experts but are not trained educators can result in a very frustrating experience for students.</p>
                        <p>Our program is designed and taught by individuals who are expert educators <em>in addition</em> to being subject matter experts. Our hand-crafted curriculum was painstakingly designed, using educational best practices and careful thought into how people learn and think. Every point in the curriculum has been deliberated and debated upon by our instructors, from the exact order in which to teach concepts, to the analogies used to clarify each concept, to how the exercises should be structured so they pack the maximum educational punch.</p>
                        <p>We also believe that you don't have to quit your job and your life to learn to code. We're often questioned on how we cover on a part-time basis what other programs cover in full-time programs. The answer is that if the curriculum is designed and taught by top notch educators, you can learn a lot more in a lot less time.</p>

                            There wasn't a single lesson during this program where I didn't have fun and learn something. The instructors provide a structured environment, clear succinct exercises, and open-ended projects, helping you build your skills one step at a time. I can't rate this experience highly enough. I strongly recommend it to anyone. The connections you make with teachers, TAs, and even your classmates are worth the price of admission alone.
