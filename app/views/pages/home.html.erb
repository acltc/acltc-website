      <h3 class="mb40 mb-xs-16">The nation's greatest coding instructors</h3>
      <p>It’s not good enough to be taught by a programmer who isn’t also a skilled educator. Actualize only hires Lead Instructors who are experienced educators in addition to being experienced software developers. Each Lead Instructor is empathic, funny, engaging, and most importantly, loves to teach. That is why many of our graduates have told us that their Lead Instructor is hands-down the best part of their Actualize experience.</p>

      <h3 class="mb40 mb-xs-16">Powerful student relationships</h3>
      <p>Some bootcamps pre-record their lessons or have a remote instructor broadcast to multiple cohorts simultaneously. What makes the Actualize experience so powerful is that your expert Lead Instructor is dedicated exclusively to your small cohort. We’re passionate about education, so we don’t cut corners to achieve scale. The Lead Instructor’s full-time job is to be there for your cohort alone. Actualize is about the very real relationship between an expert Lead Instructor, and you, the student.</p>

      <p>We obsess over the art and science of teaching people to code. We spend an inordinate amount of time and effort fine-tuning our curriculum to make it fit with the way that students learn and think. In the words of one student who transferred to Actualize from another program, "You teach the concepts so well that it takes 30 minutes to learn what it took me 5 hours to learn in my previous school."</p>
      <p><strong>We care about the craft of teaching programming so much that we wrote the book on it!</strong> It covers the best practices on curriculum and instruction we've honed over many years in the field. You can download the book for free below.</p>

We employ the same educational expertise to the Job Hacking curriculum as we do with our coding curriculum. Working with our Career Advisor, our students start with the basics - building a great resume and online presence, and progress to the point where they’re actually connecting with employers in the industry.</p>
