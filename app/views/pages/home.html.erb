                <p>Actualize is the only coding bootcamp that exclusively hires Lead Instructors who have professional experience in <strong>both education and software engineering</strong>. Your Lead Instructor is your guide and mentor during the 12 weeks of Live Training, and will directly teach you every concept that you need to know to become a software developer. Because of their expertise in instruction and pedagogy, Actualize is able to teach on a part-time basis what other coding bootcamps take an entire day to teach.</p>
                <p>Your Lead Instructor is there for you - both in and out of class - to guide you, celebrate your success, and help you solve some of the toughest problems you'll have ever encountered. Each Lead Instructor is empathic, funny, and engaging, and that is why many of our graduates have told us that their Lead Instructor is hands-down the best part of their Actualize experience.</p>

                                    Peter Jang is a Lead Instructor as well as the Dean of Instruction at Actualize. He has had several career changes - he first graduated with a masters in mechanical engineering and worked as a consultant, writing software in C, C++, Matlab, VBA, and Python. He then followed his passion for teaching by earning a masters in education, and taught high school math for 6 years. More recently he changed into the career of web development, working at a startup as a full stack web developer. Currently he teaches full time as an Actualize Lead Instructor, which is a perfect blend of his passions for both teaching and programming.

                                    Dani attended the University of Santa Cruz and graduated with a BS in biology. While pursuing a career in that field, she became interested in programming and attended a coding bootcamp to learn as much as possible, unaware of the life change she was about to make. She fell in love with coding and worked as a front end developer and designer. But she also found a passion for mentoring and education - and taught web development as well. Motivated by growth mindset, passionate about learning, and engaged by problem solving, she found the perfect intersection becoming a Lead Instructor at Actualize.

                </h2>
                <p>Most people wrongly assume that once you learn to code, software development jobs will just fall into your lap. This is not the case. The speed at which someone lands a job after a coding bootcamp is correlated to how good they are at job hunting, which is a skill set independent to coding. Because of this, we treat the job hunting skill set with the same importance as the coding skill set.</p>
                <p>Our unique job-hunting curriculum, which we refer to as <strong>Job Hacking</strong>, is taught throughout the bootcamp itself. Then, once the coding bootcamp is complete, we continue to work with each graduate by individually coaching them through their job hunt through weekly job hacking exercises and checkins. Our approach is unique not just in the coding bootcamp industry, but even in the larger world of white-collar career coaching, and is based upon years of research and experience.

                    Learn How To Learn
                </h2>
                <p>We believe that teaching people to code is much, much more than dumping students in a room and throwing articles and exercises at them, as is the style of most coding bootcamps. As educator-developers, we study the art and science of teaching people to code with a passion that borders on fanaticism. (Okay, maybe it is fanaticism!)
                </p>
                <p>
                Our educational approach does not focus on teaching our students a particular language or technology, but instead how to think as a software engineer, with the ability to teach themselves any technology on their own. In fact, the majority of our graduates go on to work with other languages and frameworks than the ones we teach in class.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is also our educational approach that allows us to teach on a part-time basis what other programs take an entire day to teach. In the words of one student who transferred to Actualize from another program, "You teach the concepts so well that it takes 30 minutes to learn what it took me 5 hours to learn in my previous school."
