                        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>We believe that education shouldn't simply be delivered by subject matter experts. A lot more goes into teaching than knowing the material well. Curriculum needs to be designed in a way that it can be digested by the human mind. Instruction needs to be delivered so that the concepts are clear, revealing not just the how but also the why. Hands on exercises need to be constructed in a way that they reinforce the lessons in a way that they become ingrained to the point where the lessons can be used in many different contexts.</p>
                        <p>That's why our program is designed and taught by individuals who are expert educators <em>in addition</em> to being subject matter experts. Our hand-crafted curriculum was painstakingly designed, using educational best practices and careful thought into how people learn and think. Every point in the curriculum has been deliberated and debated upon by our instructors, from the exact order in which to teach concepts, to the analogies used to clarify each concept, to how the exercises should be structured so they pack the maximum educational punch.</p>
                        <p>We also believe that you don't have to quit your job and your life to learn to code. We're often questioned on how we are able to teach on a part-time basis what other programs teach on a full-time basis. The answer is that if the curriculum is designed and taught by top notch educators, you can learn a lot more in a lot less time.</p>

                            I'm a graphic designer and my experience has always been in the print design world. As I have been looking for work it was pretty obvious that today's employers were looking for graphic designers that have strengths in both the print and web design world. While web design was something I had experimented in, I did not have enough experience to showcase these skills in my portfolio. ACLTC gave me the opportunity to build on those skills and learn new coding skills. Since the bootcamp I have been able to get a great job where I now use both my print and web design skills.
