<p>1. The code found <a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/ruby?exercise=DarkseagreenLinearAggregators" target="_blank" class="primary-color">here</a> contains errors on multiple lines. Run the code and you'll see an error message for yourself. Fix the error and run the code again, and you'll encounter another error message. Repeat this process until you've fixed all the errors, which will be confirmed when the code runs without displaying any error messages. (Note: To fix an error, simply change the line of code to anything that is valid.)</p>
