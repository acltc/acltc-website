                  The ‘transfer_funds_to’ method is essentially dealing with two different bank accounts (a.k.a. two bank account instances). How does it know which bank account to withdraw money from and which bank account to deposit money to?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Recreate the BankAccount in your own text editor.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Add an attribute that indicates whether the account is a checking account, a savings account, or a CD.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Update the withdraw method so that if one withdraws money from a CD, they also lose an additional 10% of the money they’re withdrawing due to penalties. For example, if one is withdrawing 10 dullars, they also get hit with a 1 dollar penalty. So if they were withdrawing 10 dollars from a CD that contained 100 dollars, they’d be left with 89 dollars.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Update the transfer_funds_to method to ensure that one cannot transfer funds from a CD or to a CD.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
