  {title: "The Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints", content: "<img src=\"https://acltc-blog-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/blog_pic/blog_pic/35/fast_food.jpg\">\r\n\r\nFast food is hardly health food, but when you’re on the road or it’s late at night, sometimes it’s your only option. These are the menu options to look for that will fill you up without filling you out.\r\n\r\nGeneral Guidelines for Finding the Least Unhealthy Options\r\n\r\nLet’s just come out and say it: fast food is generally not healthy. It’s all processed and packed with sodium, unhealthy fats, and excess preservatives. When you compare it to meals you could make at home, there’s obviously no way that fast food could be considered healthy options. Andy Bellatti, Registered Dietician, explains:\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that when it comes to chains like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King, it isn’t so much about “healthy options”, but rather about “what is the least worst?” This is an important distinction to make.\r\nSo as long as you approach those “I have to eat something” roadtrip moments with that mindset, you’ll find it to be a less stressful experience. As Bellatti puts it, there’s more to fast food than the nutrition facts:\r\n\r\nWe have to get away from the concept that a meal is “healthy” because it contains fewer than X number of calories or because it has X grams of protein. The issue with most fast food items is that even if they are among the ‘better’ choices, they are usually cooked in unhealthy oils and offer very little in terms of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\r\nWith all of that in mind, Bellati suggests that there are a few tips you can follow at most chains to find those food items that are the lesser of evils:\r\n\r\nAvoid fried foods when possible.\r\nOpt for smaller portions if they’re available (or share food with someone).\r\nPass on sugary beverages like soda and drink water or unsweetened iced tea instead.\r\nBe wary of sauces(dressings, sandwich toppings, and for dipping)because they can be high in sugar and sodium.\r\nSay no to mayo. It can save you a lot of calories and fat.\r\nWhen in doubt, use your smartphones to look up nutrition information and healthy options.\r\nDoing some research is especially helpful if you have special dietary restrictions. Something reasonable for one person could be really unhealthy for another, so don’t hesitate to check nutrition facts online or ask for them at the counter or drive-thru.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhat Should I Look for on a Nutrition Label?\r\nDear Lifehacker, I've always been told to look at nutrition labels, but I totally don't…\r\nRead more\r\nWhat Menu Items to Look For\r\n\r\nYou’re bound to come across one the places listed below. Places like McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and even Subway are scattered across rest stops and street corners all over the country. Here are some specific items to look for and avoid at each of these locations.\r\n\r\nMcDonald’s\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nFor breakfast, consider these items:\r\n\r\nEgg White Delight McMuffin: This version of the regular Egg McMuffin is the least unhealthy breakfast sandwich on the menu. It’s same size as the other breakfast sandwiches, but is lower calorie, lower in processed carbohydrates, and lower in fat. You can even save yourself from some extra calories and fat if you ask for no margarine and no cheese.\r\nFruit ‘N Yogurt Parfait: This item is one of the least unhealthy choices on the entire McDonald’s menu. It’s a filling portion that gives you good dairy fats and delicious fruit without being a fat or sodium bomb. The only minor catch is it’s pretty high in added sugars.\r\nFruit & Maple Oatmeal: The oatmeal is not nearly as healthy as you might think, but it’s still one of the better options for breakfast. It has a lot of added sugar, however, so ask for no brown sugar and you’ll cut your sugar intake in half, but still get sweetness from the fruit.\r\nSausage Burrito: These burritos aren’t too terrible compared to most of the sandwiches, even if they’re smaller. They are high in protein and have fewer calories than most of the breakfast sandwiches. However, this is per burrito and they come in a pack of two, so consider splitting an order with someone.\r\nOne thing to remember: getting a value meal adds a hash brown to your breakfast. While tasty, items like the McDonald’s hash brown are a great example of stuff that’s best avoided. It’s all processed carbohydrates fried in oil that adds an unnecessary 150 calories, 15g of carbs, and 9g of fat to your meal. Additionally, go with water, tea, or black coffee if you’re ordering beverage.\r\n\r\nFor lunch and dinner, consider these items:\r\n\r\nRanch Snack Wrap: Get the grilled chicken version since it has a good amount of protein and is lower in fat and carbs when compared to most sandwich items on the menu. It’s pretty high in sodium for how small it is, but you can reduce that by asking for no buttermilk ranch sauce.\r\nSide Salad: A fairly safe choice at most fast food places because it’s all vegetables, and there’s nothing extra thrown on top of it. When you add on the dressing things obviously change, but if you go with a balsamic vinaigrette or simple Italian it remains a pretty decent option. Of course, you should keep in mind that while both the Ranch Snack Wrap and side salad are considered better choices, they are small. They’re sides and snacks—so they won’t be as filling as other options.\r\nArtisan Grilled Chicken Sandwich: If you want chicken, the grilled variety is usually the best choice. This sandwich is pretty high in processed carbs (43g, mostly from the bun sauce), but it’s still one of the better sandwich options on the menu. It can fill you up without going overboard.\r\nHamburger: It might seem a little surprising, but the basic McDonald’s hamburger is probably your best bet if you want a sandwich. It is pretty low in sodium for most fast food sandwiches, and even though the portion size is smaller than a sandwich like the Big Mac, it can make a great snack to tide you over, or go alongside that side salad. Even a cheeseburger isn’t that terrible if you want to upgrade a little.\r\nApple Slices: If you want a healthy side option to replace those fries, or you want a snack and drive-thru is your best bet, apple slices are a good choice.\r\nIf it seems like most of these menu items are pretty small, you’re not crazy. Items at fast food restaurants are super calorie dense and packed with processed ingredients, so sticking to smaller portions is key. Also, be sure to avoid fries and soda wherever you go if possible. The extra calories and sugars can really pile up. Not to mention the fact that most of the calories from fast food items like fries and crispy chicken are empty calories.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhat Are Some Tasty, Healthy Alternatives to Soda?\r\nI've decided it's finally time to get rid of my twice-a-day soda habit, but the problem…\r\nRead more\r\nBurger King\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nConsider ordering these items:\r\n\r\nTendergrill Chicken Sandwich: This sandwich is one of the least unhealthy chicken sandwiches you can find. It’s filling, has a decent amount of protein, and has less fat and processed carbs than any fried or crispy chicken. Ditch the mayo that comes standard and you can save yourself almost 100 extra calories.\r\nWhopper Jr.: Just like McDonald’s, ordering a Whopper Jr. or even a basic hamburger is one of the safer bets. A somewhat filling snack that has less of the frills that make bigger burgers worse for you. Say no to mayo here too.\r\nChicken Apple & Cranberry Garden Fresh Salad: A lot of fast food salads can be traps because they pile on croutons and dressing, but this one isn’t all that bad. It comes with the Tendergrill dressing, but if you want to make it even better for you, ask for Ken’s Lite Honey Balsamic dressing instead and consider using only half the packet.\r\nSalad Wraps: The chicken salad wraps are some of the best options on the BK menu, but they’re not so great if you’re watching your sodium. Otherwise, these are decent snacks that can tide you over until you can get a well-rounded meal.\r\nGenerally, french fries are not a healthy option, but if you really want some, Burger King’s Satisfries aren’t as bad when you compare them to other french fries. A value size has 190 calories, 8g of fat, 28g of carbs, 2g of protein, and only 210 mg of sodium (which is pretty low for a food covered in salt). Compare that to the regular fries that have 240 calories, 10g of fat, 34g of carbs, and 330 mg of sodium. They’re still fried, so again, it’s not healthy for you, but it’s not the worst fried thing out there. Still, you’re probably better off going with apple slices. When it comes to deciding between McDonald’s and Burger King, it really comes down to taste. Both places have comparable options as long as you avoid the breaded and fried stuff.\r\n\r\nTaco Bell\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nConsider ordering these items:\r\n\r\nSoft Tacos: If you want something off of the classic menu, the beef soft taco and chicken soft taco can’t be beat. The chicken version has less fat and more protein, and if you want to go with the supreme version that has lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream, you get a few more calories and fat, but it’s not much worse for you.\r\nCantina Power Bowl: One of the newer options, the Cantina Power Bowl can be pretty filling without being an absolute gut bomb. There’s even a veggie version that has much less fat without sacrificing protein. This is one of the more filling options on the menu too.\r\nThe Fresco Menu: The Fresco Menu is fairly new, but it’s got some of the least unhealthy options Taco Bell has ever had. A Fresco soft taco is small but it makes for a great, less terrible snack. Go for a couple Fresco tacos instead of getting a sodium bomb like the massive XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito. Other items on the Fresco Menu include burritos and crunchy tacos.\r\nWendy’s\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nConsider ordering these items:\r\n\r\nJr. Cheeseburger: As with McDonald’s and Burger King, a basic cheeseburger or hamburger at Wendy’s is a simple and safe bet. It’s smaller, but avoiding the nasty stuff at fast food places means controlling your portions. Smaller items like this make that much easier to do. Plus they’re usually cheaper!\r\nUltimate Chicken Grill Sandwich: This the least unhealthy chicken sandwich Wendy’s has to offer. If you want chicken, avoid the fried stuff and go with this sandwich instead. Just as filling without the extra fat and carbs.\r\nChicken Go Wraps: The grilled version is a pretty decent snack. It may not be as filling, but definitely one of the better chicken options out there.\r\nChili: This is one of Wendy’s most popular sides, and despite the moderately high levels of sodium, it’s one of the least unhealthy options on the menu. Go for a small chili instead of fries for your side, or pair this up with a Jr. Cheeseburger for a filling—and better for you—meal.\r\nGarden Side Salad and Caesar Side Salad: Both of these options are low in calories, fat, and sodium. If you avoid croutons and go light with the dressing, these are great options. Wendy’s also has light versions of Newmann’s Own dressings, which are lower in fat, carbs, and calories. If they give you several packets of dressing, consider only using one, or even just a half of one to cut back even more.\r\nKFC\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nLook for these items:\r\n\r\nSalads: KFC’s salads are relatively tame when compared to other fast food chain salads. Just skip the croutons and don’t overdo it with any of the available dressings (especially the KFC Creamy Parmesan Caesar dressing). For healthier dressing options, go for Marzetti Light Italian Dressing. And again, consider using only half or less of what they give you.\r\nSides: Corn on the cob and green beans. The green beans, for example, is the healthiest of all the available sides. The coleslaw and mashed potatoes—with or without gravy—aren’t the worst available options either. They’re both fairly low calorie and low in fat when compared to carb and fat bomb sides like the macaroni and cheese or potato wedges.\r\nKentucky Grilled Chicken: KFC’s grilled chicken is actually some of the most reasonable fast food out there. Compared to Original Recipe or extra crispy, the grilled chicken options have all the protein without the added carbs and sodium. Say no to the extra crispy and fried chicken strips whenever possible.\r\nOriginal Recipe Chicken Breast without Skin or Breading: If you prefer the way the Original Recipe chicken is cooked, however, the without-skin or breading option isn’t too terrible either. Just order the original recipe chicken breast and take off the skin yourself. You get the flavor and protein, but ditch the breading—where all the sodium, fat, and carbs are.\r\nSubway\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nSometimes it’s worth it to find places that don’t have a drive-thru, but can serve you quickly. Fortunately, Subway and other sandwich places make it fairly easy to customize what you’re ordering. Here are some tips for avoiding the unhealthy stuff:\r\n\r\nStick to a 6” sandwich: Some footlongs may only be five bucks, but they can be deceptively bad for you (despite Subway’s “healthy” marketing campaign). Andrew Wilder at Eating Rules notes that even a Veggie Delite without cheese starts at 540 calories and can have nearly 2400 mg of sodium. When you add things like mayo and other sauces you’re getting double the dose. Watch out for the sodium levels of sandwiches on the “6g of fat or less menu” too. Just because the sandwich is listed on that menu doesn’t make it automatically healthy.\r\nChoose 9-grain wheat or hearty italian bread: Sara Ipatenco at Livestrong recommends getting these breads because they have fewer calories and less fat than the other breads. The 9-grain wheat 6” has 210 calories, 40g of carbs, 2g of fat, and 280 mg of sodium. Compare that to the supposedly healthier 6” flatbread that has 220 calories, 38g of carbs, 4.5g of fat, and 340 mg of sodium.\r\nSkip the get chips or soda: You’re just adding on calories, sugar, and sodium you probably don’t need.\r\nAvoid the fancy sauces: Sweet onion teriyaki sauce might sound delicious, but you could be adding hundreds of calories to your sandwich if you’re not careful with the sauces. Yellow mustard is okay, but mayo and the fancier stuff will cost you.\r\nGo for the right veggies: Load up on free veggies and consider swapping out lettuce for spinach. You’ll get a similar texture with more nutrients.\r\nSubway also has some soups, like the Homestyle Chicken Noodle and Tomato Basil, and salad options that can be somewhat decent as well. Follow the basic guidelines above and this place is can be one of the better options out there.\r\n\r\nChipotle\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nChipotle, like Subway, doesn’t have a drive-thru, but it’s another place that can be more than worth stopping for. Bellatti has some suggestions for how to get the healthiest meal out of a place like Chipotle:\r\n\r\nAt a chain like Chipotle, a legitimately healthful meal is doable. Some of the items are high in sodium, but a burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, different salsas, guacamole, and lettuce is an example of a whole-food based meal that offers plenty of nutrition. You can even throw in some sofritas in there. Of course, it is worth pointing out that it is definitely possible to have a much unhealthier meal at Chipotle...\r\nRemember, at Chipotle the calories can add up really fast if you add in too much to your burrito or bowl. If possible, get tons of fajita veggies, lettuce, and flavorful salsas, and skip double scoops of meat or all the filler rice and beans. Go for the burrito bowls too. You’ll avoid those massive burritos that easily blow past 1000 calories. Chipotle’s salads are great options as well.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Chipotle makes it really easy to customize your meal, and they clearly post all of their nutrition information inside every restaurant. They even have a nutrition calculator to help you build the perfect meal for your dietary needs before you go.\r\n\r\nThings That Seem Healthier, but Aren’t\r\n\r\nThe Least Unhealthy Items at Seven Popular Fast Food Joints\r\n\r\nSome fast food items are marketed as being the “healthy” option, but don’t be fooled. Salads,or things that call themselves salads,are the biggest abusers of this. Don’t ever assume that something called a salad is healthy. For example, the Premium Bacon Ranch Chicken Salad at McDonald’s is not very healthy at all. It’s packed with as much fat and sodium as one of their burgers before you even add any dressing to it.\r\n\r\nYou should also be careful of things labeled “premium.” This can give off the vibe that the ingredients are higher quality, and thus healthier, but it’s rarely the case. For example, the Premium Grilled Chicken Bacon Clubhouse Sandwich at McDonald’s is one of the least healthy sandwiches on the menu. Yes, it’s “premium” chicken, but the sodium from the the extra sauce and the “artisan” bun make it a poor choice.\r\n\r\nLastly, be wary of vegetarian options. Just because something is vegetarian or made without meat doesn’t mean that it’s healthier. For example, the BK Veggie Burger at Burger King might seem like it’s a healthier option than a regular burger, but it’s actually packed with sodium and potentially worse for you than a Whopper Jr. Remember, when in doubt, always double check by looking up the fast food chain’s menu and nutrition facts. It can be confusing, but it’s worth looking into for you your health.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhy There's So Much Confusion Over Health and Nutrition\r\nIf you believed the internet, you'd think there's huge debate over whether eggs, coffee,…\r\nRead more\r\nEating a Little Fast Food Isn’t the End of the World\r\n\r\nWhile it’s good to avoid the worst stuff when you eat at these places, it’s important to keep everything in perspective. Bellatti explains that eating fast food every once in a while won’t ruin your whole diet, so don’t let it get you down:\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to nutrition, it is the big picture that matters. If you find yourself in a situation where your options are either Wendy’s or McDonald’s four or five times a year—and the bulk of your diet is low in processed foods, rich in whole plant-foods, and you avoid or strictly limit sugar-sweetened beverages—then those four or five meals are the exception to the rule and are truly not worth worrying about. The problem, of course, is that the average American diet is in such a crummy state (low in fruits and vegetables, high in added sugars, high in red meat) that fast food meals only exacerbate the problem.\r\nEssentially, don’t sweat it too much if you have to grab some Mickey D’s on your long drive. What’s important is not making it a habit and that you build other healthier habits instead. Yes, you want to try and still avoid the really bad stuff at these fast food joints, but a burger or two won’t set you back completely.", admin_id: 1, slug: "the-least-unhealthy-items-at-seven-popular-fast-food-joints"}
