TlaseVideo.create(episode: 2, title: "Dealing with Tricky Errors", description: "Many times, error messages pinpoint the exact line of code that is buggy. Sometimes, though, an error message may seem to pick on a line that is perfectly valid. Learn how to understand what these tricky error messages are telling you.", vimeo_url: "335459005")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 4, title: "English Code Isn’t English", description: "Code doesn't always translate into English precisely the way you think it might. By understanding how the computer actually understands your code, you'll be able to write better code.", vimeo_url: "335459683")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 6, title: "The Constraints of the Computer", description: "Here I use a pattern known as \"array mapping\" to discuss what is probably the most important aspect of computer programming - the ability to talk to a computer. Being able to talk to a computer requires you to know what the computer understands, and what it doesn't understand.", vimeo_url: "335457755")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 7, title: "Artificial Intelligence", description: "Did you ever wonder how artificial intelligence works? AI is a very broad topic, but in this video, I give you a glimpse into how a software engineer can get a computer to mimic human intelligence.", vimeo_url: "335458192")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 12, title: " How to Find Stuff", description: "When dealing with lots of code, how do you remember what you put where? Even tougher, when dealing with someone else's code, how do you figure out where they put everything? You can actually find anything you need with this one, weird trick. Actually, it's not weird at all. But it's really simple!", vimeo_url: "335464756")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 13, title: "Debugging a Real Website Error", description: "I received an alert that there was an error on my website. So instead of just fixing it, I recorded myself fixing it so you can see for yourself how a software engineer fixes real bugs!", vimeo_url: "335465279")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 14, title: "How to Isolate the Problem", description: "When something goes wrong, isolating the problem is one of the most important techniques you'll need if you want to fix it. In this video, we use a powerful analogy from IT that will help you learn to systematically isolate any bug.", vimeo_url: "335466025")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 15, title: "Automate Everyday Tasks Without Code", description: "With the software engineer mindset, you can actually automate day-to-day tasks without even using code. Watch how I automatically populate a Google spreadsheet in real-time with Slack posts that I want to save for later. It's fun, and something that you can get started with right away even if you don't know how to code (yet).", vimeo_url: "335462540")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 16, title: "How to Use Stack Overflow", description: "If you've ever Googled for coding help, you've probably found the Stack Overflow website. But sometimes, there are tons of answers to a given question! How do you know which one is right?", vimeo_url: "335462911")

TlaseVideo.create(episode: 18, title: "Installing Stuff!", description: "I don't know about you, but when I first started out coding, I had a terribly difficult time downloading programming languages and tools. I've found that so many people are deterred from learning to code simply because they can't get past the installation process! But if you know what you're doing, installing stuff doesn't have to be that hard. (Most of the time, anyway...)", vimeo_url: "335461773")
